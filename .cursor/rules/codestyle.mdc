Do not write comments unless explicilty specified

Instead of if/else try to use premature exit from loop

When updating do the smallest change possible
Follow KISS and YAGNI principles
Avoid repetetive code patterns
Avoid creating extra functions that were not explicitly set
Avoid deep nesting of conditionals, use if () { .. return } inestead of if/else
Prefer to use array map/reduce/etc methods over complex ifs

STOP USING EMOJIS EVERYWHERE

Use Bun for instlling packages
Bun for running tests
