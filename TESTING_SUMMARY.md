# UI Testing Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented UI tests for React Ink components using ink-testing-library. All 17 tests are passing.

## Test Coverage

### App Component (6 tests)
- ✅ Renders LogPane when logs are present
- ✅ Shows ActivityPane when input is not shown
- ✅ Shows InputPane when input is shown
- ✅ Displays current state when available
- ✅ Renders logs when they are added
- ✅ Doesn't crash when no state is available

### LogPane Component (4 tests)
- ✅ Renders logs correctly (including tagged entries)
- ✅ Handles empty logs array
- ✅ Respects verbose mode
- ✅ Limits logs to prevent overflow

### ActivityPane Component (3 tests)
- ✅ Shows hint message when no activity
- ✅ Renders without crashing when activity is present
- ✅ Has correct structure when active

### StateTransitionPane Component (4 tests)
- ✅ Displays current state information (URL, title)
- ✅ Handles missing state gracefully
- ✅ Displays timestamp
- ✅ Formats long URLs appropriately

## Key Learnings

1. **Mocking is Essential**: The App component requires extensive mocking of dependencies (ExplorBot, CommandHandler, logger)

2. **Async Initialization**: Components with useEffect need small delays to allow async operations to complete

3. **State Management**: Components using singleton patterns (like Activity) require careful test setup

4. **Error Boundaries**: ink-testing-library provides good error reporting when components fail

5. **Text Output Testing**: Tests verify the actual terminal output as strings
